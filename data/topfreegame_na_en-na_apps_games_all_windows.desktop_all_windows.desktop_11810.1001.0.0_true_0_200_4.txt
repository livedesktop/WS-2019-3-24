In fact, at first glance you might think of it as a bit of a joke. I mean seriously, no graphics or sound at all? What kind of game is that? Long before quality graphics and sound was available on game systems, there were playable stories. Some have called them ‘Interactive Fiction’, others ‘Text Adventure Games’. Instead of using the machine’s graphic and sound capabilities, they used the player’s imagination. This game has been specifically designed to reignite that lost game genre while implementing a modern interface that makes for a surprisingly refreshing gaming experience.\r\n\r\nThis Christian themed story begins with an accident. An accident that leaves you, as the player, unable to recall not only where you are, but who you are as well. Awakening in an overturned van, being suspended by your seatbelt, you must first figure a way of escape. Once free to explore the area, you find yourself in a world that not only seems strangely empty, but openly hostile as well. As the story unfolds and your memory begins to return, you begin to question whether these strange happenings are limited to the immediate area.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9XV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Magic Jigsaw Puzzles","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52130.9007199266251857.7feb058a-c625-4f5f-abeb-49fd397d702b.22d7390a-515b-4905-b530-2fdc31a55183","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0078D7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60893.9007199266251857.d67abe26-4aa0-464d-bf49-b09d89371944.29809234-2484-49f7-93a3-2bda17f4ae68","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0078D7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54623.9007199266251857.eec58277-5b1e-4650-b4e6-ccfeea766020.68f465ed-ebd4-4543-848b-928c9fef01c7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0078D7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1788.9007199266251857.61e28be5-5e37-4a0a-a1c6-166daf5a647c.ae6a1969-5443-4dbe-a632-117a2aac9704","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47140.9007199266251857.61e28be5-5e37-4a0a-a1c6-166daf5a647c.f3b913ce-027c-468a-a676-21e4653b6d08","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["XIMADINC.MagicPuzzles_np8fj6akx2czy"],"ContentIds":["44bbb6f1-48a1-ee8f-18f4-0c1b3223b20f","10c6c61e-795b-7ad6-7ec1-187fd0353030","9cd57804-b3bf-b326-52a8-19ceb5032780"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"50 million downloads worldwide!

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US:

In addition, the deck contains four each of \"Wild\" and \"Wild Draw Four\" cards\r\n\r\nEach player is dealt 7 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down to form a draw pile. The first player has to match the card in the discard pile either by number or color or the player can throw down a Wild Card else he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, great. Otherwise play moves to the next person.\r\n\r\nIn Uno The card deck contains four colors with numbers from 0 to 9, as well as Action cards - \"Reverse\", \"Skip\", \"Take Two\", \"Wild\" and \"Wild Take Four\".\r\n\r\nIf you forget to say Uno, you are penalized by having to draw two more cards from the pile.\r\n\r\nUno Card Game trains concentration, memory, and reaction time.\r\n\r\nThe first one to get rid of their cards wins!\r\n\r\nDo you like playing Uno?

So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games.
